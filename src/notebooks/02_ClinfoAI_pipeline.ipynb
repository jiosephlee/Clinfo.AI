      "Literature Summary: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the United States varies across studies, populations, and time periods. A study by Chiu and Ndeffo-Mbah (2021) estimated a nationwide prevalence of 1.4% and a seroprevalence of 13.2% as of December 31, 2020, using a Bayesian semi-empirical modeling framework[3]. A study by Jones et al. (2023) found that 96.4% of persons aged ≥16 years had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by the third quarter of 2022[4]. The prevalence of COVID-19 was also found to be influenced by socioeconomic factors, with more disadvantaged neighborhoods having higher prevalence rates[2], and rural counties showing an increase in prevalence rates over time[5]. Prevalence rates among specific populations, such as dental hygienists, were reported to be low[1]. The use of at-home COVID-19 tests also increased significantly over time, indicating a possible rise in prevalence[6]. A study by Benatia et al. (2020) estimated a median population infection rate of 0.9% between March 31 and April 7, 2020, with variations across states[7].\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the United States varies, with estimates ranging from 0.9% to 96.4% depending on the population, time period, and methodology of the study. Further research is needed for more accurate and up-to-date estimates.\n",
